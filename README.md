# Spamy -  Way to Avoid Junk SMS

## Problem Statement
We have been encountring junk sms from different sources either from local mobile numbers or ones without number. The ones without number 
are hard to block eventually they can make our inbox lock really messed up just like trash.

## Provided Solution
The Demo Application was build to separate those junk messages from the real messages from your contacts.

## Results
This application worked very well when installed on clean/fresh device i.e. newly restored device. Because of the fact, message extension 
do not filter or take into consider the message to check if it has been checked by user three time. So that message will keep hitting you.

### Hint:
All you need to change a check in its extensions app to make it work like mentioned.
